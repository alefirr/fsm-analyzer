# Finite-state machine analyzer

Having a file containing a FSM parameters, implement the representation of this FSM in the computer memory.

After that, identify which states of the FSM are deadlock or unreachable.

## How to run
**First, compile the program:**
```
g++ automata.cpp -std=c++11 -o automata
```

**When compiled, run with:**
```
./automata
```
